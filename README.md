# MoodSwings

## By Tysean Canada and Elizabeth Fatade

Mood Swings is a project that will use technologies to perform facial emotion recognition to accurately determine a user's mood through facial expressions. With the mood detected, it will also include a display that will tell the users different methods and possibly music recommendations to properly get through that current mood.

## Key Technologies 

### OpenCV Python

Python Library that allows for image and video processing

### Keras

An open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks.
